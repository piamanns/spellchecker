""" Function that recursively calculates the Damerau-Levenshtein distance
    between a given word and all keys in a trie data structure.

    Implementation idea:
    There is no need to recalculate the whole matrix needed for
    the Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm for words that share the same prefix
    in the trie: just adding a new row for the next letter will suffice.
    This recursive approach speeds up the search for possible correctly
    spelled candidate words significantly.

    Based on Steve Hanov's very informative blog post on
    http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=114.

    The following implementation also takes the possibility of the transposition
    of two characters into account.
