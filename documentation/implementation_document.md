# Implementation Document

Work in progress.

## Architecture
(To be added)

## Algorithms and data structures

### Trie

- Time complexity for adding and lookup
- Space complexity for different alphabet sizes

### Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm

- Basic implementation: comparing two words. Time complexity.
- Comparing misspelled word to all words in large dictionary:
    - for loop / recursive approach
    - time complexity for both approaches
