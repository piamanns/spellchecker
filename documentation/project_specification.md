# Project Specification

The aim of the project is to implement a spelling checker and corrector in Python. 

## Algorithms and Data Structures

The dictionary with correctly spelled words is generated from a text file containing a word list for some language and stored as a **trie data structure**.

When the user enters a word for spellchecking, the program will attempt to find the word in the dictionary. If the word does not match, the program will utilize an algorithm for calculating the **Damerau–Levenshtein distance** from the misspelled word to the words in the dictionary. Words with the lowest Damerau–Levenshtein distances are returned as possible candidates for correct spelling.
