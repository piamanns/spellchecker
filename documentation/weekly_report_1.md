# Weekly Progress Report 1

During the initial week of the course I have familiarized myself with the course material.

After deciding on a spellchecker/spelling corrector as a course project, I read up on different types of implementations of spelling correctors. After discussing the topic with the course instructor, I decided on the setup suggested in the course material: a trie data structure for storing the dictionary with correctly spelled words, and finding suggestions for the correct spelling by calculating the Damerau–Levenshtein distance from the misspelled word to the words in the dictionary. I spent some time familiarizing myself with both the trie data structure and algorithms for calculating the Damerau–Levenshtein distance utilizing dynamic programming.

I also initialized a Python project and set up a GitHub-repository for the project.

My next step will be to implement the generation of and retrieval of data from from the trie data structure. I will begin with generating the dictionary from a restricted word list, before proceeding to more comprehensive word lists that are available in the public domain.

Time spent: 6 hours.
